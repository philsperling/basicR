### Hypothesis test
#We will use the lung dataset from the survival package

# Task 1: explore the new dataset

# Task 2: Is there a difference in age between dead and alive patients? (use the variable status to determin group)

# Task 3: is there a difference in median survival time between male and female? 

# Task 4: Is there a linear relationship between age and ecog score? 

# We will go into more depth on specific tests next time.
