### Cleaning up data
#If you have issues with exercise 1, use this command: 

# Task 1: set all colnames to lower case 

# Task 2: Get an overview of the dataset

# Task 3: Remove patients who smoke, have a BMI>30, or has hearth disease and remove the columns you just removed data from

# Task 4: change genhlth(<=4),income(=8), and age(median split) to binary

# Task 5: make diabetes into a factor: 

### Visualization 
# Task 6: Make a histogram of age

# Task 7: Make a boxplot of age grouped by diabetes status 

# Task 8: make a scatterplot of age and parity, grouped by case status from the infert data set
